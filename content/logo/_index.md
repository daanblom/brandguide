# Logo Guidelines

Our logo is the cornerstone of our brand identity. These guidelines ensure consistent and professional usage across all platforms.

## Primary Logo

{{< logo image="/images/logo-primary.svg" alt="Primary Logo" width="200" height="60" background="transparent" >}}
The primary logo should be used in most situations. It includes both the symbol and wordmark.

## Logo Variations

### Symbol Only
{{< logo image="/images/logo-symbol.svg" alt="Logo Symbol" width="60" height="60" background="transparent" >}}
The symbol can be used independently when space is limited or for favicon purposes.

### Wordmark Only
{{< logo image="/images/logo-wordmark.svg" alt="Logo Wordmark" width="160" height="40" background="transparent" >}}
The wordmark can be used independently when the symbol is already present in the design.
